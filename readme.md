ðŸš€ Project: Applied ETL Pipelines for Finance & Risk Analytics
-This multiproject initiative involves building a series of robust ETL pipelines that extract live financial data from Yahoo Finance and store it in a PostgreSQL database. The pipelines are designed with a focus on real-world use cases in Risk Analytics, including credit, fund performance, and liquidity risk.

ðŸ§  Each module integrates theoretical finance and quantitative methods, blending core financial mathematics with practical tools to enhance applied understanding.

ðŸ”§ Key Tools & Tech:
- ETL Pipelines (Python, Yahoo Finance API)
- PostgreSQL for structured storage
- Power BI for real-time dashboards
- SQL for deep-dive data exploration
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for analytical modeling

ðŸ“Š Learning Goals:
- Build modern portfolio analysis workflows
- Apply early-stage machine learning models to financial and energy market datasets
- Strengthen my understanding of data pipelines, visualization, and analytical reasoning in industry-relevant contexts

#### This evolving project is a personal training ground to level up my data science skills while aligning with the demanding analytical needs of finance, risk management, and energy markets.
